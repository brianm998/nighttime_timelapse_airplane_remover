outlier group data processing process

First, run ntar against an image sequence with the command line arg --write-outlier-group-files set.

This will output a directory next to the image sequence with '-outliers' appended to it.

Once these files are generated, copy them to outlier_data/unsorted in the source dir

Then run

outlier_check.pl outlier_data/unsorted

which will prompt the user to identify each outlier group

afterwards, run ntar -q to generate hough transform csv files

then run outlier_analysis.pl, which will regenrate ShouldPaint.swift with the updated data
